## USAGE

Each section of my professional profile contains information such as my resume, about me, work, and contacts. As you click on each one of them it will take to it's file. 

I created my professional profile using Fluid Design or Responsive design to make sure that the website should scale with the user screen size by adding "meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" in the head of HTML and using percentages for height and width instead of pixels, this way when someone resizes their browser window, the Html tags will shrink or expand accordingly and not break the page. 

Using the @media breakpoints in the CSS file, will cause the CSS file to use different CSS styles based on the screen size of the device its on. /MEDIA QUERIES/.

My professional profile was deployed using GitHub pages so that I can share it with other profesionals who can visit it using a unique address known as Uniform Resource Locator (URL) on the internet or the World Wide Web.
